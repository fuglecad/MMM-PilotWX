I feel obliged to state that this module should only be used for entertainment purposes. Yes, the data is being pulled from the very same sites that you use ordinarily, but the thought of any of you relying on this module’s data for actual flights scares the shit out of me. Not that you would. You’re pilots. You’re smarter than that, I hope. :-)
